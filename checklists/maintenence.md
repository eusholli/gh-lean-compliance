# Data Maintenence Checklist

## Prerequisite

It is important to fully understand the principles of "Privacy by Design" to best complete this checklist. Please visit [Data Protocol](https://dataprotocol.com) for prerequisite training courses.

## Introduction

Once data has been captured it usually encounters Data Maintenance. This can be defined as the supplying of data to points at which Data Synthesis and Data Usage occur, ideally in a form that is best suited for these purposes.

It often involves tasks such as movement, integration, cleansing, enrichment, changed data capture, as well as familiar extract-transform-load processes.

It is important to ensure all data used by the software is:

- adequate – sufficient to properly fulfil your stated purpose;
- relevant – has a rational link to that purpose; and
- limited to what is necessary – you do not hold more than you need for that purpose.

## Checklist

| Phase | Description | Principles | 
| :---: | :---------- | :--------- |  
| Idea | Data minimization is an active function of our software development | Proactive not Reactive,  |
| Idea | We collect bare minimum data | Privacy as the Default,  |
| Idea | We mask&#x2F;generalize data when possible | Privacy as the Default,  |
| Idea | We only collect personal data we actually need for our specified purposes. | Privacy Embedded into Design,  |
| Idea | We have sufficient personal data to properly fulfil our specified purposes. | Full Functionality,  |
| Test | We have appropriate processes in place to check the accuracy of the data we collect, and we record the source of that data | Privacy Embedded into Design,  |
| Production | We have a process in place to identify when we need to keep the data updated to properly fulfil our purpose, and we update it as necessary | Privacy as the Default,  |
| Production | We comply with the individual’s right to rectification and carefully consider any challenges to the accuracy of the personal data. | Respect for User Privacy,  |
| Production | As a matter of good practice, we keep a note of any challenges to the accuracy of the personal data. | Respect for User Privacy,  |
